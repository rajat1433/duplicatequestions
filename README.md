# duplicatequestions

Question-and-answer (Q&A) websites such as Quora provide users with a platform to ask 1
questions that other users on the site may answer. However, many of the questions being
asked at any given time have already been asked by other users, usually with different
wording or phrasing. Ideally, these duplicate questions would be merged together into a
single canonical question, as doing so would provide a number of benefits:

• It saves the question asker time if their question has already been answered
previously on the site. Instead of waiting minutes or hours for a response, they can
get their answer immediately.

• Frequently repeated questions can frustrate highly engaged users whose feeds
become polluted with redundant questions. Many users who answer questions in a
particular topic see slight variations on the same question appearing many times in
their feed, and this creates a negative user experience for them.
